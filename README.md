# UottaHack-2025

Repository for the UottaHack 7 Hackathon.

This program parses through text files containing urls of breached data.
It then inserts all the parsed information into an SQL database which can then be queried.

This was a first hackathon for the team and it taught us a lot about software design flow and
the necessity of a clear design vision before development.
